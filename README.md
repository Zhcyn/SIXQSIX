3D Dice is an augmented reality application that allows you to roll a virtual dice anywhere you'd like! All you need is your phone and this app. Using Apple's latest ARKit tech, 3D Dice is able to detect horizontal surfaces in the real world for you to throw dice onto. It even animates them being rolled when you shake your phone or tap the roll button! The current project is still under development, and the functions will be improved in the future. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
